# SkypeWords
Just a silly little thing I made in a couple days. I packaged it into a .jar and hooked it up to an autohotkey macro. Pressing the hotkey would open a small swing window with 4 text boxes. They will make a big word out of smaller words in a notepad document. The autohotkey script will then copy the document's contents, close it and try to paste them into skype. Did it mostly to irritate my friends. The 3rd text box, if you hit enter on it, will generate a random word combination. The 4th will embelish ascii on either side of a string but isnt quite done. It's done a bit crudely, word length will effect how the letters look, but for most words it looks about right.
